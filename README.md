# Histopathologic Cancer Detection using PyTorch

This notebook aims to detect cancerous cells in histopathologic scans of lymph node sections using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented with PyTorch. We'll go through the steps of data exploration, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
